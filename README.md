### Howdy there, folks! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Collin A. Bullock and I am a full stack web developer!  I've been coding since literally the 90s, but last year I decided to make it a career by attending the web development certification program at University Of Illinois Chicago (in conjunction with Fullstack Academy).  There I got further training in and experience with HTML, CSS, JS, Node, Postgres SQL, React, and much more!

Prior to launching myself feet first into the wide world of coding, I was a professional educator for many years doing everything from working in public schools special needs departments to managing a School of Rock!  Teaching, especially passing down my love and rock and roll, remains a huge part of my life!  

Here are some projects I've made to show off what I can do:
- <a href="http://www.collinbullock.com">My personal website</a>: I buil this website in HTML, with JavaScript used for interactivity.  It was styled from a Bootstrap CSS tempelate, which I heavily modified to match my own asthetic preferences.  It is also, of course, optimized for mobile!
- <a href="https://collinspuppybowl.netlify.app/">Puppy Bowl</a>: Yo, do you love puppies? I knew you did, you're not a monster! Anyway, puppy bowl uses a restful API to handle fetch requests! It dispalys a variety of dogs, uses filter functions to provide a search , and allows users to submit their own dogs! Built in a react framework, utilizing basic JSX functionality, and styled using Material UI dependecies.
- <a href="https://strangersthingscfrt.netlify.app/">Stranger's Things</a>: Another e-commerce site, this one more akin to an etsy or a craigslist. Built using React frameworks as well as HTML, CSS, and JSX for interactivity; and styled (with optimization for mobile) vis material UI dependencies to resemble the asthetics of the popular Netflix show, the site pulls from an API to handle CRUD functionality. User are able to register and log in, using auth tokens, and are then able to post and read listings from other users!
- <a href="https://simpsonspedia.netlify.app/">Simpsonspedia</a>: SimpsonsPedia was built in React using a publicly available API of characters and episodes from the popular TV show "The Simpsons". Onlick functionality was provided via JSX, and styling (done to look like the classic program, and optimizied for mobile) was built from the ground up using CSS, just as an exercise in working without a pre-built framework.

Here are some additional skills of mine:
- Customer service.
- Project management.
- Video production and video editing.
- Audio production, mixing, and editing.
- Multi platform live streaming.
- SEO
- UI/UX
- Music performance
- Public speaking
