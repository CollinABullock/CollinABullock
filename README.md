### Howdy there, folks! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Collin A. Bullock and I am a full stack web developer!  I've been coding since literally the 90s, but last year I decided to make it a career by attending the web development certification program at University Of Illinois Chicago (in conjunction with Fullstack Academy)
